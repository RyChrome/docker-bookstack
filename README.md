You have to have docker installed on your machine. 

From there, clone the repository using `git clone`, `cd` into it, and then run `docker-compose up` to get the server running locally.

and after that open your Browser and go to http://localhost:8080 . You can login with username 'admin@admin.com' and password 'password'.
